# ROPASCI✂️

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** Android game built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.

But there's a twist...  
The game is **rigged** so the computer has a higher chance of winning. 😈

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created for **educational purposes**, to show how a game can be secretly manipulated behind the scenes — just like some gambling or "luck-based" games in real life (Judol).

## 🤖 How it works

- You play rock, paper, or scissors.
- The computer *pretends* to play fair, but the code is designed to let it win more often.
- It teaches how easy it is to rig something that looks random and fair on the surface.

## 📱 Built With

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Android Studio

> This project is for **learning only**. Don’t use rigged logic in real competitive games!
